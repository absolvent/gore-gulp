# gore-gulp

## What does this package contain?

**gore-gulp** is a simple and universal Gulp configuration boilerplate for
JavaScript projects.

**gore-gulp** supports React, React Native and Webpack based projects
especially well.

Currently it provides set of predefined gulp tasks that suit most typical
JavaScript projects. Instead of configuring gulp on your own, you can just
setup your project using **gore-gulp** using this one-liner (this would be your
entire gulpfile.js if you do not need some non-js build steps. You have to
handle those on your own):

```JavaScript
// gulpfile.js

var gg = require("gore-gulp"),
    gulp = require("gulp");

gg(__dirname).setup(gulp);
```

...and then use predefined **gulp** tasks:

```Bash
$ gulp lint # check your code using highly demading linter to prevent bugs
$ gulp test # perform regression tests to refactor with confidence
$ gulp webpack # pack your code to make it production-ready
```

**gore-gulp** takes advantage of
[package.json#directories](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#directorieslib)
feature. If you configure your `package.json` like this:

```JSON
{
    "directories": {
        "dist": "./dist",
        "lib": "./my-package"
    }
}
```

It would make `webpack` task to look for all `*.entry.js`, `*.entry.jsx` and
`*.entry.coffee` files inside your `./my-package` directory and create
production-ready output files inside `./distdirectory`.

## Why gore-gulp is so special?

**gore-gulp** is not like traditional boilerplate. Currently for my job I
maintain almost 10 production websites and I find copy-pasting configuration
files or even generating project stubs with generators like
[yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) really painful (with all respect to
[yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), scaffolding just does not suit my needs). What I
intend to achieve is to collect best practices associated with JavaScript,
Webpack and popular frameworks (especially the React family which I love) and
keep them in one possibly zero-configuration package.

If you want to use **gore-gulp** all you need to do is to add this package
as your `package.json` `devDependency` and benefit from no-brainer predefined
tasks.

Feel free to open an issue if youâ€™d like to see any changes.

## Features

### Vendor (non-NPM) libraries support

To support libraries from other sources than NPM (like bower) you need to
specify `alias` key inside your `package.json`. For
example if you need to use bower edition of
[RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) (for some strange reason)
you can configure your project like this:

```JSON
{
    "alias": {
        "rxjs": "bower_components/rxjs/dist/rx.all"
    },
    "directories": {
        "dist": "my-output-folder",
        "lib": "library-with-bower-components"
    },
    "name": "my-library-with-bower-components"
}
```

And then just use it:

```JavaScript
// library-with-bower-components/index.entry.js

import Rx from "rxjs";
```

Internally, `alias` key is an exposed
[webpack configuration field](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-alias).
Aliased paths are processed by **gore-gulp** before passing them to `webpack`
to ensure that they are relative to base package directory (the one that holds
`package.json`).

## Examples

### How to start a project with gore-gulp?

1. Add `directories.dist` and `directories.lib` sections to your `package.json`.
2. Setup your `gulpfile.js` using **gore-gulp**:

    ```JavaScript
    var gg = require("gore-gulp"),
        gulp = require("gulp");

    gg(__dirname).setup(gulp);
    ```

3. Generate code using `gulp webpack` (use `NODE_ENV=production` for more
optimizations).

## Summary

The goal of this package is to provide a one-liner that configures your
gulpfile to instantly jump into coding using the best, modern JavaScript
practices.
