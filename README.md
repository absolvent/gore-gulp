# gore-gulp

## What does this package contain?

**gore-gulp** is a simple and universal Gulp configuration boilerplate for 
JavaScript projects.

**gore-gulp** supports React, React Native and Webpack based projects 
especially well.

Currently it provides set of predefined gulp tasks that suit most typical 
JavaScript projects. Instead of configuring gulp on your own, you can just 
setup your project using **gore-gulp** using this one-liner (this would be your 
entire gulpfile.js if you do not need some non-js build steps. You have to 
handle those on your own):

```JavaScript
// gulpfile.js

var gg = require("gore-gulp"),
    gulp = require("gulp");

gg(__dirname).setup(gulp);
```

...and then use predefined **gulp** tasks:

```Bash
$ gulp lint # check your code using highly demading linter to prevent bugs
$ gulp test # perform regression tests to refactor with confidence
$ gulp webpack # pack your code to make it production-ready
```

**gore-gulp** takes advantage of 
[package.json#directories](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#directorieslib) 
feature. If you configure your `package.json` like this:

```JSON
{
    "directories": {
        "dist": "./dist",
        "lib": "./my-package"
    }
}
```

It would make `webpack` task to look for all `*.entry.js`, `*.entry.jsx` and 
`*.entry.coffee` files inside your `./my-package` directory and create 
production-ready output files inside `./distdirectory`.

## Why gore-gulp is so special?

**gore-gulp** is not like traditional boilerplate. Currently for my job I 
maintain almost 10 production websites and I find copy-pasting configuration 
files or even generating project stubs with generators like 
[yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) really painful (with all respect to 
[yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), scaffolding just does not suit my needs). What I 
intend to achieve is to collect best practices associated with JavaScript, 
Webpack and popular frameworks (especially the React family which I love) and 
keep them in one possibly zero-configuration package.

If you want to use **gore-gulp** all you need to do is to add this package 
as your `package.json` `devDependency` and benefit from no-brainer predefined 
tasks.

Feel free to open an issue if youâ€™d like to see any changes.

## Summary

The goal of this package is to provide a one-liner that configures your 
gulpfile to instantly jump into coding using the best, modern JavaScript 
practices.
